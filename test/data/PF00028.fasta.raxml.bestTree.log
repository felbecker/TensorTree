INFO: Insertion-size is generated from Geometric distribution with a mean of 3 and a variance of 6. The variance may be different from the user-defined value (if any) due to the definition of each distribution. 
INFO: Deletion-size is generated from Geometric distribution with a mean of 3 and a variance of 6. The variance may be different from the user-defined value (if any) due to the definition of each distribution.
